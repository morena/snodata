A Node.js foundation app to handle logins with services such as foursquare and facebook.
We aim to use this app as a starting point for Node.js apps where we will be using multiple APIs and will allow user registration/login using social media services APIs such as Facebook and Foursquare


In Italian snodata means "dexterous", "flexible", It's a pure coincidence that our app is also built with Node.js :)
